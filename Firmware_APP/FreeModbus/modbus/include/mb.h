 * and could for example be stored in a flash.<br>

 * function with the register address and the number of registers to read
 * as an argument. The application should then read the actual register values
 * (for example the ADC voltage) and should store the result in the supplied
 * buffer.<br>
 * If the protocol stack wants to update a register value because a write
 * register function was received a buffer with the new register values is
 * passed to the callback function. The function should then use these values
 * to update the application register values.
